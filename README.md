# quiz.js

This is a quick and easy jquery script to display a functional quiz, using the quizzing method at LookListenLearn.org.  

The quiz can be contained in either csv or json, and will ask the questions in order. if you miss one, that question is added to the end of the quiz, allowing you another chance. You finish when you get all the questions correct.

The data file is specified in the html file, and the javascript file will use that, see which format it is and create the quiz accordingly.

Please look at the sample csv and json files to see the specific formatting.
